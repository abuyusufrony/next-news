                        OpenAI recently announced Operator, an AI agent designed to handle web-based tasks on its own. It can handle tasks like booking a table or shopping online, simplifying digital interactions for everyday tasks. <br />

                        However, we think its potential goes beyond convenienceâ€”it could empower people who lack computer skills by enabling them to complete tasks like filling out forms or navigating complex websites with ease.
